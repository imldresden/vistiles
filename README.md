# VisTiles

The VisTiles prototype illustrates how multiple mobile devices can be combined
and coordinated for visual data exploration. The basic ideas and principles
behind this research prototype can be found in our publication:

## Installing and Running VisTiles

We developed and tested this prototype with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6.
After installing Node and NPM, please execute the following commands.

If you start the app the first time, you have to install all required
dependencies ([see the list](package.json))
```
npm install
``` 

Start the app using our start script
```
npm start
```

If successful, the web server listens on
`http://<your-server-ip>:3000/` or `http://localhost:3000/`. 

First, you should open a new browser window and connect to to a debug console
via `http://<your-server-ip>:3000/debug`. This console allows you to simulate
the 2D position and orientation of connected devices.

To actually connect a device, open a new browser window and type
`http://<your-server-ip>:3000/`. Next, select an adequate device configuration
from the displayed list and click *NEXT*. Then, if you are not using an external
tracking system to capture device locations, click *SIMULATE*. Otherwise, you
can click *START PAIRING*.
